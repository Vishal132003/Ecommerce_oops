ðŸ›’ eCommerce Store (Python OOP Console App)
Hey there!
This is a simple eCommerce application built using Python and Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles.
The whole app runs in the terminal and lets users shop, add items to their cart, and checkout.

I created this to practice OOP concepts in a fun way. Hope you find it helpful!

What this project does:

Shows a list of products

Lets users add products to a cart

Displays the items in the cart

Calculates the total during checkout

It doesnâ€™t use any external libraries or databases â€” just pure Python.

Why I built this:

I wanted a project to apply everything Iâ€™ve learned about OOP â€” like classes, objects, methods, encapsulation, etc.
So I thought: why not create a small online shopping experience?
Itâ€™s simple, yet covers real-world logic.

How it works:

The project has the following files:

product.py â€” defines the Product class

store.py â€” manages the list of products

cart.py â€” handles cart operations

user.py â€” creates a user with their personal cart

app.py â€” main file that runs everything

You just run app.py, and everything happens in the terminal.

How to run:

Make sure you have Python installed, then run:

python app.py

Follow the prompts like:

View Products

Add to Cart

View Cart

Checkout

Exit

It's that easy!

Concepts Used:

Classes and Objects â€” represent products, users, and carts

Encapsulation â€” each class handles its own data

Composition â€” a user has a cart

Methods â€” used for product display, adding to cart, checkout, etc.
