# 🛒 eCommerce Store (Python OOP Console App)

Hey there! 👋  
This is a simple eCommerce application built using **Python** and **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** principles. The whole app runs in the terminal and lets users shop, add items to their cart, and checkout.

I created this to practice OOP concepts in a fun way. Hope you find it helpful!

## 📌 What this project does

It simulates a basic shopping experience:

- Shows a list of products
- Lets users add products to a cart
- Displays the items in the cart
- Calculates the total during checkout

It doesn’t use any external libraries or databases — just pure Python.

## 💡 Why I built this

I wanted a project to apply everything I’ve learned about **OOP** — like classes, objects, methods, encapsulation, etc.  
So I thought: why not create a small online shopping experience? It’s simple, yet covers real-world logic.

## 🛠️ How it works

The project has the following files:

- `product.py`: defines the Product class
- `store.py`: manages the list of products
- `cart.py`: handles cart operations
- `user.py`: creates a user with their personal cart
- `app.py`: main file that runs everything

You just run `app.py`, and everything happens in the terminal.

## ▶️ How to run

Make sure you have Python installed, then:

```bash
python app.py
Follow the prompts like:

markdown
Copy
Edit
1. View Products
2. Add to Cart
3. View Cart
4. Checkout
5. Exit
It's that easy!

🧠 Concepts Used
Here are the OOP concepts I applied:

Classes & Objects: Represent products, users, and carts

Encapsulation: Each class handles its own data

Composition: A user has a cart

Methods: For product display, adding to cart, checkout, etc.
